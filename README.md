Calculus Calculator on iOS

This Calculator Tool is inspired by my TA jobs in Differential Equation and Linear Algebra, 
as well as the powerful TI Calculator that can calculate Differentiation and Integration.

I want it to be able to do some basic calculations such as:

Integration/Differentiation

Eigenvalue/Eigenvector of Matrix

LUP transformation of Matrix
(more...)

as well as all the steps of solving the problem.
